Jojo Rabbit is a comedy set in Germany in 1944 as World War II is ending. The plot is about Johannes "Jojo" Betzler and his imaginary friend, a witty Hitler. Johannes is a lonely 10-year-old Aryan boy with a humorous and innocent loyalty to the nazis. Throughout the movie, we follow the duo from Johannes's perspective.

Johannes dreams of becoming an Aryan war hero, but his dreams are quickly thwarted. We learn that he is nicknamed Jojo Rabbit as he could not strangle a rabbit when ordered to do so at a Nazi youth training camp. The episode affects Jojo greatly and results in him blowing himself up with a hand grade in a comical attempt to impress the commanders and prove he is not a squeamish 10-year-old boy. The incident renders him unfit to become the Aryan war hero he dreamed of becoming.

After the incident, Jojo resides with his mother, Rosie, where he recovers from his injuries. Rosie is a covert anti-fascist, and we quickly learn that she is hiding a Jewish girl, Elsa, in the attic.

When Jojo first meets Elsa, he is horrified and thinks she is a monster. However, as Jojo experiences Elsa being a fun and loving girl,  albeit frightened for her life, their relationship quickly evolves into a love and hate relationship. The relationship makes Jojo question his loyalties.

The movie centres around Jojo's battle with nazism. Behind the fascistic facade, Jojo is a frightened boy. His sister died, and his father disappeared in the war. He desperately longs to prove he is a capable man and that he can face the world with all its hardships. However, his new acquaintances slowly make him realize that his dream of becoming a nazi soldier does not represent the man he wants to be.

The movie is a feel-good movie, and even though it shows many horrific events surrounding the war, it does so from the perspective of a 10-year-old. The context is often represented in comical and hilarious ways, which makes it hard not to accept the humour; however, the humour is sometimes silly to the point where it splits the crowd.

In addition, it is no secret that the movie is a considerable risk because it is a comedy set during World War II and because its main protagonist is a 10-year-old boy with an imaginary friend, Hitler. It is not a movie for everyone, but it is a sharp, fun, and loving movie for those who can look past the lack of seriousness towards the war.
