# Star Wars Site README

This repository contains the following:

- A Star Wars site built with C#, Blazor (server-side), and Umbraco Heartcore as a data source.
- A GitHub Action to publish a docker image for the star wars site.
- A Nomad Pack to easily deploy the latest version of the star wars site to my HomeLab.

I built this site with the following tools:

- VSCode (Yes I am a little crazy because I am not using a "real" IDE, and instead I am customizing VSCode to my needs. Maybe someday I will need to use a real IDE again ðŸ‘€)
- .NET with HotReload. (Aint nobody got time for that)
