# Features pattern

The features pattern is a pattern I prefer when I am allowed to use it ;-) Utilizing MediatR allows for a really easy pipeline, that can be extended with tools like AutoMapper, FluentValidation or something else to implement features in an application.

The pattern maps well with use cases as the queries and commands are not limited in what they can handle. As such the
pattern puts the CRUD operations belonging to a specific use case under that use cases namespace, and the implementation
uses whatever it needs to extend the pipeline to e.g., be able to run some algorithm, retrieve orders from a database,
or read characters from the star wars universe from Heartcore ðŸ˜‰ This mapping makes it super quick to maintain a
codebase, if issues are mapped to use cases in the issue board.

In larger applications, the features can be located in a separate library, that can either be extended with an API or consumed by an application to provide underlying features. The pattern fits well with the Onion Architecture or a micro-service pattern where features are considered as a separation of concerns.
